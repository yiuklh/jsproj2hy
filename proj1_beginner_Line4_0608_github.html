        <h2>Commuting time by minutes: Biking or Walking</h2>
        <h4>~~ an Intro JavaScript learning project by kyiu~~</h4>

        <p>Frequently there are subway problems at TTC stations delaying regular commutes. So a passenger decide to either bike or walk going to his/her destination.</p>

<p><em>Q: How did I come up such idea?</em></p>
    
<h4><em>BACKGROUND STORY:</em></h4> 
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/2003-the-great-north-america-blackout" target="_blank">CBC Archives, August 14, 2003</a>
    
<p>On August 14, 2003 at around after 4pm EST, there was a sudden blackout in the GTA. As more news emerged, it turned out to be the “Great North America Blackout” that affected most of Southern Ontario and Northeastern United States. Some communities in cities were without power for only 1 to 3 days, but some were affected for a week.</p>    
    
<p>The power outage in that evening rush hours had caused all the transits systems, included TTC, to immediately shut down. Many daily commuters who were in Downtown finding alternative ways return homes in the suburbs. Some luckier commuters were able to take the overcrowded replacement shuttle buses. While many had walked northbound (and uphill) along Yonge Street from Downtown going back homes. Stories from people had reported that walking from Union Station to Finch Station took at least 6 hours. Some commuters might had walked another 1 to 4 more hours for their trip to homes, depending on how far they reside away from the City of Toronto, which is commonly refer as “north of Steeles Avenue”.</p><br> 
    
<h4><em>Ideas to borrow from:</em></h4>
<p>If similar situation to happen again, I certainly would like to know how long to "horsepower" commute in between TTC stations.</p>
