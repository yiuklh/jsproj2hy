This is an introductory JavaScript learning project at @hackeryou.

Project 2 focus on using jQuery to create simple front-end interactive user interfaces.

In this project, I have chose the "TTC stations by minutes" as my topic. 

While my end goal is wanting to create on-screen clicks that would show a user the total commuting time (by biking or walking) in between any 2 or 3 stations that reflects the real-world senarios possible for a one-way trip.

However, I currently have very limited proficiency with JS & jQuery coding; and therefore, I have to begin with the most simplest commuting senarios + With the helps from mentors brainstorming the codings into small steps.
