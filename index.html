<p>Commuting time by minutes: Biking or Walking
~~ an Intro JavaScript and jQuery learning project by kyiu~~</p>

<h3>
<a id="intro" class="anchor" href="#intro" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Intro</h3>

<p>Frequently there are subway problems at TTC stations delaying regular commutes.
So a passenger decide to either bike or walk going to his/her destination.</p>

<h3>
<a id="beginner-level" class="anchor" href="#beginner-level" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Beginner-level</h3>

<p>Only "Line 4 Sheppard-Yonge"</p>

<p>Assuming these SIMPLE conditions</p>

<ul>
<li>Only Line 4 Sheppard-Yonge!</li>
<li>Only Biking as mode of commute</li>
<li>Always begin at the first station. Eg. It is Sheppard for Line 4</li>
<li>Only One-way trip (A to B), no backtracking</li>
<li>No transfer stations</li>
<li>For simplicity: Time duration is express in minutes and as whole numbers that’s no decimals. 
No need to convert time to include hours, or seconds.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="intermediate-level" class="anchor" href="#intermediate-level" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Intermediate-level</h3>

<p>Only "Line 4 Sheppard-Yonge"</p>

<p>Assuming conditions</p>

<ul>
<li>Same conditions set in the Beginner-level</li>
<li>Can choose either one mode of commute to begin: Biking OR Walking. </li>
<li>No mixture of commuting modes on a trip.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="advanced-level" class="anchor" href="#advanced-level" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Advanced-level</h3>

<p>Assuming conditions</p>

<ul>
<li>Only One-way trip</li>
<li>No backtracking</li>
<li>Review Key Idea:</li>
  <ol>
  <li>GET something: station buttons btn class</li>
  <li>LISTEN something: button click event</li>
  <li>DO something: Display info when button clicks</li>
  </ol>
<li><strong>NOTE: Setup user interface with two button classes. Eg) .btn1, .btn2 </strong></li>
  <ul>
  <li>Let clicks btn1 means variable choice1 to START</li>
  <li>Let clicks btn2 means variable choice2 to STOP</li>
  <li>Difference between the two stations is the total commute time</li>
  <li>We are doing this because to have a “visual” understanding about how the codes work.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="extra-advanced-level" class="anchor" href="#extra-advanced-level" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extra Advanced-level</h3>

<p>Assuming conditions</p>

<ul>
<li>Add-on arrays for the remainder three routes: Line 1, Line 2, Line 3</li>
<li>However, can <u>ONLY CHOOSE ONE</u> of the four line routes. 
eg) Not go from a station to Line 1 to another station on Line 2</li>
<li>Always begin at any station on a line and finish at another station <u>on the same line</u>, (A to B). 
Therefore, no shortcut transferring to different line route.</li>
<li>Only One-way trip</li>
<li>No backtracking</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="super-advanced-level" class="anchor" href="#super-advanced-level" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Super Advanced-level</h3>

<ul>
<li>Think of any “real-world” scenarios possible going from an origin to a destination such as ...</li>
<li>Allows transfer station interchange to another line. ie) (A to B), (A to B to C ...)</li>
<li>Only One-way trip</li>
<li>No backtracking</li>
<li><p>Can begin from any station going to any station for the trip. (Note: Counting can be tricky for those stations locate at the end points of a line and are not connecting to another line.)</p></li><br>
<li><p>BONUS: Convert total minutes into more familiar time expression in “hours, minutes”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Q: How did I come up such idea?</p>

<p>CBC Archives, August 14, 2003
&lt; <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/2003-the-great-north-america-blackout">http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/2003-the-great-north-america-blackout</a> &gt;</p>

<p>On August 14, 2003 at around after 4pm EST, there was a sudden blackout in the GTA. The power outage in that evening rush hours had caused all the transits systems, included TTC, to immediately shut down.</p>  

<p>As more news emerged, it turned out to be the “Great North America Blackout” that affected most of Southern Ontario and Northeastern United States. Some communities in cities were without power for only 1 to 3 days, but some were affected for a week.</p> 

<p>Many daily commuters in Downtown were finding alternative ways to return homes in the suburbs. Some luckier commuters were able to take the overcrowded replacement shuttle buses. While many had walked northbound (and uphill) along Yonge Street from Downtown going back homes. Stories from people had reported that walking from Union Station to Finch Station took at least 6 hours. Some commuters might had walked another 1 to 4 more hours for their trip to homes, depending on how far they reside away from the City of Toronto, which is commonly refer as “north of Steeles Avenue”.</p>

<p>A: If similar situation to happen again, I certainly would like to know how long to "horsepower" commute in between the TTC stations.</p>
